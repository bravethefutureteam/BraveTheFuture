    <string name="ri3d">Robot in 3 Days (RI3D) is a program meant to first but not foremost entertain and secondly, to inspire and spark ideas. RI3D is a great way to start teams o during the first week of Robot Build Season. Particularly for low resource teams, RI3D allows them to consider di erent prototypes that they would otherwise not have been able to build. RI3D is a great resource for many teams. Many of the members on our team have benefited greatly from learning what other RI3D have had to o er in previous years.</string>
